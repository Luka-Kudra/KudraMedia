# Kudra Media
(2021) I made this website in 3 days as my first project. It was supposed to bring people to me for website development.
In the beginning I was really proud of myself but now looking at it its just a static minimalistic website. 
But hey, if you like minimalistic stuff you will like it! 

(2024) Its funny now looking at this, its not even optimized for all screen sizes, and it almost has no purpose,
just a few words and buttons, but at the time it made me proud of myself.
